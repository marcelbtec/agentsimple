# Insurance Claims Processing Multi-Agent System

A sophisticated multi-agent system for processing and evaluating insurance claims using different types of AI agents with varying levels of autonomy and capabilities.

## Overview

This system implements a hierarchical multi-agent architecture for insurance claim processing, featuring different types of agents with increasing levels of autonomy and decision-making capabilities. The system is designed to handle various types of insurance claims (auto, property, health, liability) and provides comprehensive evaluation, risk assessment, and decision-making capabilities.

## System Architecture

The system is built around a hierarchical architecture that progresses from simple rule-based processing to complex multi-agent collaboration. At its core, the system processes insurance claims through four distinct levels of sophistication:

### Level 1: Reactive Agent
The foundation of the system is the Reactive Agent, which operates on simple rule-based evaluation. This agent processes claims in milliseconds, making it ideal for high-volume initial screening. It requires no LLM involvement and can handle millions of requests, serving as an efficient first line of defense.

### Level 2: Assistant Agent
Building upon the reactive foundation, the Assistant Agent introduces LLM capabilities and basic tool integration. This agent takes 2-3 seconds to process claims, using approximately 1.5k tokens per evaluation. It's well-suited for handling thousands of claims per minute while providing more sophisticated reasoning than the reactive agent.

### Level 3: Autonomous Agent
The Autonomous Agent represents a significant advancement in capability, featuring full autonomous operation and advanced tool usage. This agent operates in a self-directed learning loop, maintaining a pattern database for improved decision-making. Processing takes 4-5 seconds per claim, using about 3k tokens, but provides high-accuracy evaluations through its memory-based decision-making system.

### Level 4: Multi-Agent System
At the pinnacle of the architecture is the Multi-Agent System, which coordinates multiple specialist agents and includes a senior arbitration system. This system takes 8-10 seconds to process claims, using approximately 6k tokens, but provides the highest level of accuracy and comprehensive decision-making. It's best suited for critical decisions that require thorough analysis and multiple perspectives.

## Core Components

### Data Structures

The system revolves around two primary data structures:

The `InsuranceClaim` class encapsulates all relevant information about a claim, including its ID, type, amount, filing date, description, and policy number. It also maintains claimant history, associated documents, risk indicators, and current status.

The `EvaluationResult` class captures the outcome of claim evaluations, storing the recommendation (approve/deny/investigate), confidence score, risk level assessment, detailed reasoning, and any red flags identified during processing.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The system implements a sophisticated Model Context Protocol that structures the interaction between agents and tools. This protocol consists of four layers:

The Tool Definition Layer establishes the foundation with JSON Schema validation and strongly typed parameters. The Registration Layer manages tool availability and discovery, while the Execution Layer handles the actual tool calls and result processing. Finally, the Integration Layer combines multiple tool outputs into coherent decisions.

This protocol provides significant advantages over traditional function calling, including better type safety, clearer separation of concerns, and standardized testing procedures.

## Design Philosophy

The system employs several key design patterns to maintain flexibility and scalability:

The Strategy Pattern allows different agents to implement the same evaluation interface, making it easy to swap agents without changing the system. The Observer Pattern enables comprehensive logging and monitoring of agent decisions and actions.

For complex decisions, the Chain of Responsibility pattern manages the escalation process through the multi-agent system, while the Memento Pattern allows Level 3 agents to maintain state and recognize patterns across evaluations. The Facade Pattern simplifies complex operations through the MCP tools interface.

## Performance and Optimization

The system's performance characteristics are carefully balanced across different levels:

| Agent Level | Latency | Token Usage | Cost | Accuracy |
|------------|---------|-------------|------|-----------|
| Level 1 | ~10ms | 0 | $0 | Low |
| Level 2 | ~2-3s | ~1.5k | ~$0.01 | Medium |
| Level 3 | ~4-5s | ~3k | ~$0.03 | High |
| Level 4 | ~8-10s | ~6k | ~$0.08 | Very High |

To maintain optimal performance, the system implements several optimization strategies. It caches common tool results, batches similar evaluations, and uses Level 1 agents for initial filtering. The system only escalates to higher levels when necessary, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

## Usage

```python
# Create a claim
claim = InsuranceClaim(
    claim_id="CLM123",
    claim_type=ClaimType.AUTO,
    amount=5000.0,
    date_filed=datetime.now(),
    description="Vehicle damage from collision",
    policy_number="POL456"
)

# Initialize the multi-agent system
system = MultiAgentInsuranceSystem()

# Evaluate the claim
result, metadata = await system.evaluate_claim(claim)
```

## Dependencies

The system requires Python 3.8+ and several key packages:
- Core functionality: dataclasses, enum, typing, datetime, asyncio
- Visualization: streamlit, plotly, networkx
